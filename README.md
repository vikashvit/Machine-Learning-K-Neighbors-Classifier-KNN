# Machine-Learning-K-Neighbors-Classifier-KNN

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

This data sets consists of 3 different types of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray. The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a non-parametric method used in  classification. The input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output is a class membership.

Value of K	Accuracy 
3	0.76
5	0.8
7	0.8
